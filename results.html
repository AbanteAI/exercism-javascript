Although all monoalphabetic ciphers are weak,\nthe affine cypher is much stronger than the atbash cipher,\nbecause it has many more keys.\n\nThe encryption function is:\n\n`E(x) = (ax + b) mod m`\n\n- where `x` is the letter's index from 0 - length of alphabet - 1\n- `m` is the length of the alphabet. For the roman alphabet `m == 26`.\n- and `a` and `b` make the key\n\nThe decryption function is:\n\n`D(y) = a^-1(y - b) mod m`\n\n- where `y` is the numeric value of an encrypted letter, ie. `y = E(x)`\n- it is important to note that `a^-1` is the modular multiplicative inverse\n  of `a mod m`\n- the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` only exists if `a` and `m` are\n  coprime.\n\nTo find the MMI of `a`:\n\n`an mod m = 1`\n\n- where `n` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `a mod m`\n\nMore information regarding how to find a Modular Multiplicative Inverse\nand what it means can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse)\n\nBecause automatic decryption fails if `a` is not coprime to `m` your\nprogram should return status 1 and `\"Error: a and m must be coprime.\"`\nif they are not. Otherwise it should encode or decode with the\nprovided key.\n\nThe Caesar (shift) cipher is a simple affine cipher where `a` is 1 and\n`b` as the magnitude results in a static displacement of the letters.\nThis is much less secure than a full implementation of the affine cipher.\n\nCiphertext is written out in groups of fixed length, the traditional group\nsize being 5 letters, and punctuation is excluded. This is to make it\nharder to guess things based on word boundaries.\n\n## General Examples\n\n- Encoding `test` gives `ybty` with the key a=5 b=7\n- Decoding `ybty` gives `test` with the key a=5 b=7\n- Decoding `ybty` gives `lqul` with the wrong key a=11 b=7\n- Decoding `kqlfd jzvgy tpaet icdhm rtwly kqlon ubstx`\n  - gives `thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog` with the key a=19 b=13\n- Encoding `test` with the key a=18 b=13\n  - gives `Error: a and m must be coprime.`\n  - because a and m are not relatively prime\n\n## Examples of finding a Modular Multiplicative Inverse (MMI)\n\n- simple example:\n  - `9 mod 26 = 9`\n  - `9 * 3 mod 26 = 27 mod 26 = 1`\n  - `3` is the MMI of `9 mod 26`\n- a more complicated example:\n  - `15 mod 26 = 15`\n  - `15 * 7 mod 26 = 105 mod 26 = 1`\n  - `7` is the MMI of `15 mod 26`\n\n", "code": "affine-cipher.js\nconst modInverse = (a, m) => {\n  for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {\n    if ((a * i) % m === 1) {\n      return i;\n    }\n  }\n  return -1;\n};\n\nconst areCoprime = (a, m) => {\n  while (m !== 0) {\n    let temp = m;\n    m = a % m;\n    a = temp;\n  }\n  return a === 1;\n};\n\nexport const encode = (phrase, key) => {\n  const { a, b } = key;\n  const m = 26;\n  if (!areCoprime(a, m)) {\n    return \"Error: a and m must be coprime.\";\n  }\n  return phrase\n    .replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, \"\")\n    .toLowerCase()\n    .replace(/[a-z]/g, (char) => {\n      const x = char.charCodeAt(0) - 97;\n      const y = (a * x + b) % m;\n      return String.fromCharCode(y + 97);\n    });\n};\n\nexport const decode = (phrase, key) => {\n  const { a, b } = key;\n  const m = 26;\n  if (!areCoprime(a, m)) {\n    return \"Error: a and m must be coprime.\";\n  }\n  const aInverse = modInverse(a, m);\n  return phrase\n    .replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, \"\")\n    .toLowerCase()\n    .replace(/[a-z]/g, (char) => {\n      const y = char.charCodeAt(0) - 97;\n      const x = (aInverse * (y - b + m)) % m;\n      return String.fromCharCode(x + 97);\n    });\n};", "test-output": "test_output.txt\nPASS exercises/practice/affine-cipher/affine-cipher.spec.js\n  Affine cipher\n    encode\n      \u2713 encode yes (3 ms)\n      \u25cb skipped encode no\n      \u25cb skipped encode OMG\n      \u25cb skipped encode O M G\n      \u25cb skipped encode mindblowingly\n      \u25cb skipped encode numbers\n      \u25cb skipped encode deep thought\n      \u25cb skipped encode all the letters\n      \u25cb skipped encode with a not coprime to m\n    decode\n      \u2713 decode exercism (1 ms)\n      \u25cb skipped decode a sentence\n      \u25cb skipped decode numbers\n      \u25cb skipped decode all the letters\n      \u25cb skipped decode with no spaces in input\n      \u25cb skipped decode with too many spaces\n      \u25cb skipped decode with a not coprime to m\n\nTest Suites: 1 passed, 1 total\nTests:       14 skipped, 2 passed, 16 total\nSnapshots:   0 total\nTime:        0.785 s\nRan all test suites matching /exercises\\/practice\\/affine-cipher/i.\n"},{"iterations": 1, "passed": true, "test": "all-your-base", "tokens": 2092, "instructions": "instructions.md\n# Instructions\n\nConvert a number, represented as a sequence of digits in one base, to any other base.\n\nImplement general base conversion.

only keeping the half which contains the item we're looking for.\nIt allows us to quickly narrow down the possible locations of our item until we find it, or until we've eliminated all possible locations.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n~~~~exercism/caution\nBinary search only works when a list has been sorted.\n~~~~\n\nThe algorithm looks like this:\n\n- Find the middle element of a sorted list and compare it with the item we're looking for.\n- If the middle element is our item, then we're done!\n- If the middle element is greater than our item, we can eliminate that element and all the elements **after** it.\n- If the middle element is less than our item, we can eliminate that element and all the elements **before** it.\n- If every element of the list has been eliminated then the item is not in the list.\n- Otherwise, repeat the process on the part of the list that has not been eliminated.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nLet's say we're looking for the number 23 in the following sorted list: `[4, 8, 12, 16, 23, 28, 32]`.\n\n- We start by comparing 23 with the middle element, 16.\n- Since 23 is greater than 16, we can eliminate the left half of the list, leaving us with `[23, 28, 32]`.\n- We then compare 23 with the new middle element, 28.\n- Since 23 is less than 28, we can eliminate the right half of the list: `[23]`.\n- We've found our item.\n\nintroduction.md\n#

Each node\ncontains a piece of data (e.g. the number 3), a variable named `left`,\nand a variable named `right`. The `left` and `right` variables point at\n`nil`, or other nodes.

Write code to keep track of the score\nof a game of bowling.\n\n## Scoring Bowling\n\nThe game consists of 10 frames. A frame is composed of one or two ball\nthrows with 10 pins standing at frame initialization. There are three\ncases for the tabulation of a frame.\n\n- An open frame is where a score of less than 10 is recorded for the\n  frame. In this case the score for the frame is the number of pins\n  knocked down.\n\n- A spare is where all ten pins are knocked down by the second\n  throw. The total value of a spare is 10 plus the number of pins\n  knocked down in their next throw.\n\n- A strike is where all ten pins are knocked down by the first\n  throw. The total value of a strike is 10 plus the number of pins\n  knocked down in the next two throws. If a strike is immediately\n  followed by a second strike, then the value of the first strike\n  cannot be determined until the ball is thrown one more time.\n\nHere is a three frame example:\n\n|  Frame 1   |  Frame 2   |     Frame 3      |\n| :--------: | :--------: | :--------------: |\n| X (strike) | 5/ (spare) | 9 0 (open frame) |\n\nFrame 1 is (10 + 5 + 5) = 20\n\nFrame 2 is (5 + 5 + 9) = 19\n\nFrame 3 is (9 + 0) = 9\n\nThis means the current running total is 48.\n\nThe tenth frame in the game is a special case. If someone throws a\nstrike or a spare then they get a fill ball. Fill balls exist to\ncalculate the total of the 10th frame. Scoring a strike or spare on\nthe fill ball does not give the player more fill balls. The total\nvalue of the 10th frame is the total number of pins knocked down.\n\nFor a tenth frame of X1/ (strike and a spare), the total value is 20.\n\nFor a tenth frame of XXX (three strikes), the total value is 30.\n\n## Requirements\n\nWrite code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling. It should\nsupport two operations:\n\n- `roll(pins : int)` is called each time the player rolls a ball. The\n  argument is the number of pins knocked down.\n- `score() : int` is called only at the very end of the game. It\n  returns the total score for that game.\n\n", "code": "bowling.js\n//\n// This is only a SKELETON file for the 'Bowling' exercise.

This character has, among other things, six\nabilities; strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and\ncharisma. These six abilities have scores that are determined randomly. You\ndo this by rolling four 6-sided dice and record the sum of the largest three\ndice. You do this six times, once for each ability.\n\nYour character's initial hitpoints are 10 + your character's constitution\nmodifier. You find your character's constitution modifier by subtracting 10\nfrom your character's constitution, divide by 2 and round down.\n\nWrite a random character generator that follows the rules above.\n\nFor example, the six throws of four dice may look like:\n\n- 5, 3, 1, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 5 + 3 + 6 = 14, which you assign to strength.\n- 3, 2, 5, 3: You discard the 2 and sum 3 + 5 + 3 = 11, which you assign to dexterity.\n- 1, 1, 1, 1: You discard the 1 and sum 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which you assign to constitution.\n- 2, 1, 6, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 2 + 6 + 6 = 14, which you assign to intelligence.\n- 3, 5, 3, 4: You discard the 3 and sum 5 + 3 + 4 = 12, which you assign to wisdom.\n- 6, 6, 6, 6: You discard the 6 and sum 6 + 6 + 6 = 18, which you assign to charisma.\n\nBecause constitution is 3, the constitution modifier is -4 and the hitpoints are 6.\n\n## Notes\n\nMost programming languages feature (pseudo-)random generators, but few\nprogramming languages are designed to roll dice.

to create words.\nDifferent letters have different point values, since it's easier to create words with some letters than others.\n\nThe game was originally launched in English, but it is very popular, and now the company wants to expand to other languages as well.\n\nDifferent languages need to support different point values for letters.\nThe point values are determined by how often letters are used, compared to other letters in that language.\n\nFor example, the letter 'C' is quite common in English, and is only worth 3 points.\nBut in Norwegian it's a very rare letter, and is worth 10 points.\n\nTo make it easier to add new languages, your team needs to change the way letters and their point values are stored in the game.\n\n", "code": "etl.js\n//\n// This is only a

Return the line\nnumber and contents of each matching line.\n\nThe Unix [`grep`](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/grep.html) command can be used to search for lines in one or more files\nthat match a user-provided search query (known as the _pattern_).\n\nThe `grep` command takes three arguments:\n\n1. The pattern used to match lines in a file.\n2. Zero or more flags to customize the matching behavior.\n3. One or more files in which to search for matching lines.\n\nYour task is to implement the `grep` function, which should read the contents\nof the specified files, find the lines that match the specified pattern\nand then output those lines as a single string. Note that the lines should\nbe output in the order in which they were found, with the first matching line\nin the first file being output first.\n\nAs an example, suppose there is a file named \"input.txt\" with the following contents:\n\n```text\nhello\nworld\nhello again\n```\n\nIf we were to call `grep \"hello\" input.txt`, the returned string should be:\n\n```text\nhello\nhello again\n```\n\n## Flags\n\nAs said earlier, the `grep` command should also support the following flags:\n\n- `-n` Print the line numbers of each matching line.\n- `-l` Print only the names of files that contain at least one matching line.\n- `-i` Match line using a case-insensitive comparison.\n- `-v` Invert the program -- collect all lines that fail to match the pattern.\n- `-x` Only match entire lines, instead of lines that contain a match.\n\nIf we run `grep -n \"hello\" input.txt`, the `-n` flag will require the matching\nlines to be prefixed with its line number:\n\n```text\n1:hello\n3:hello again\n```\n\nAnd if we run `grep -i \"HELLO\" input.txt`, we'll do a case-insensitive match,\nand the output will be:\n\n```text\nhello\nhello again\n```\n\nThe `grep` command should support multiple flags at once.\n\nFor example, running `grep -l -v \"hello\" file1.txt file2.txt` should\nprint the names of files that do not contain the string \"hello\".\n\ninstructions.append.md\n# Instructions append\n\n## Node process\n\nUnlike other exercises, `grep.js` is _not_ imported inside the test file `grep.spec.js`. Instead, it will be used as if it's an executable. To facilitate that, the `grep.js` file has been set-up with a shebang, and a comment that explains what this does:\n\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\n// The above line is a shebang. On Unix-like operating systems, or environments,\n// this will allow the script to be run by node, and thus turn this JavaScript\n// file into an executable.

Those cells regularly wear out and need replacing, which they achieve by dividing into daughter cells. In fact, the average human body experiences about 10 quadrillion cell divisions in a lifetime!\n\nWhen cells divide, their DNA replicates too. Sometimes during this process mistakes happen and single pieces of DNA get encoded with the incorrect information. If we compare two strands of DNA and count the differences between them we can see how many mistakes occurred. This is known as the \"Hamming Distance\".\n\nWe read DNA using the letters C,A,G and T. Two strands might look like this:\n\n    GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT\n    CATCGTAATGACGGCCT\n    ^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^\n\nThey have 7 differences, and therefore the Hamming Distance is 7.\n\nThe Hamming Distance is useful for lots of things in science, not just biology, so it's a nice phrase to be familiar with :)\n\n# Implementation notes\n\nThe Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length, so\nan attempt to calculate it between sequences of different lengths should\nnot work.

These normally contain dashes and look like: `3-598-21508-8`\n\n## ISBN\n\nThe ISBN-10 format is 9 digits (0 to 9) plus one check character (either a digit or an X only). In the case the check character is an X, this represents the value '10'. These may be communicated with or without hyphens, and can be checked for their validity by the following formula:\n\n```\n(x1 * 10 + x2 * 9 + x3 * 8 + x4 * 7 + x5 * 6 + x6 * 5 + x7 * 4 + x8 * 3 + x9 * 2 + x10 * 1) mod 11 == 0\n```\n\nIf the result is 0, then it is a valid ISBN-10, otherwise it is invalid.\n\n## Example\n\nLet's take the ISBN-10 `3-598-21508-8`. We plug it in to the formula, and get:\n\n```\n(3 * 10 + 5 * 9 + 9 * 8 + 8 * 7 + 2 * 6 + 1 * 5 + 5 * 4 + 0 * 3 + 8 * 2 + 8 * 1) mod 11 == 0\n```\n\nSince the result is 0, this proves that our ISBN is valid.\n\n## Task\n\nGiven a string the program should check if the provided string is a valid ISBN-10.\nPutting this into place requires some thinking about preprocessing/parsing of the string prior to calculating the check digit for the ISBN.\n\nThe program should be able to verify ISBN-10 both with and without separating dashes.\n\n## Caveats\n\nConverting from strings to numbers can be tricky in certain languages.\nNow, it's even trickier since the check digit of an ISBN-10 may be 'X' (representing '10'). For instance `3-598-21507-X` is a valid ISBN-10.\n\n## Bonus tasks\n\n- Generate a valid ISBN-13 from the input ISBN-10 (and maybe verify it again with a derived verifier).\n\n- Generate valid ISBN, maybe even from a given starting ISBN.\n\n", "code": "isbn-verifier.js\n//\n// This is only a SKELETON file for the 'ISBN Verifier' exercise.

Bob,\nof course, wants to maximize the total value he can get; he would gladly\ntake all of the items if he could. However, to his horror, he realizes that\nthe knapsack he carries with him can only hold so much weight (W).\n\nGiven a knapsack with a specific carrying capacity (W), help Bob determine\nthe maximum value he can get from the items in the house.

Re-implement the following built-ins `Promise` methods (without using them)\n\n- `all`: takes an array of promises and resolves when _all_ of them are resolved, or rejects when _one_ of them rejects.\n- `allSettled`: takes an array of promises and resolves when _all_ of them either resolve or reject.\n- `race`: takes an array of promises and resolves or rejects with the value of the _first_ promise that resolves or rejects.\n- `any`: takes an array of promises and resolves when _one_ of them resolves, or rejects when _all_ of them reject.\n\nintroduction.md\n# Introduction\n\nBefore the `Promise` class was introduced, there was only one way to deal with asynchronous code : the _callback pattern_.\n\nA callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and will be called once some action in that other function has finished. A common pattern for those callback functions is that they accept an \"error\" as first parameter (see example below).\n\n```javascript\nfunction callback(error, arg2, arg3) {}\n```\n\nHow is it related to asynchronous code ?\n\nHistorically, callbacks have been used in order to allow us to do some work after an asynchronous task was done and without blocking the whole program.\n\n```javascript\nfetchProduct(productId, function (error, data) {\n  if (error) {\n    // Handle the error\n  } else {\n    // Do some work\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `fetchProduct` function (which is asynchronous), takes a callback as a second argument that decides what to do when the product data has been retrieved.\n\n", "code": "promises.js\n//\n// This is only a SKELETON file for the 'Promises' exercise.

For this exercise, you need to know only three things about them:\n\n- Each resistor has a resistance value.\n- Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.\n  To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.\n- Each band acts as a digit of a number. For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.\n  In this exercise, you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands. The program will take 3 colors as input, and outputs the correct value, in ohms.\n  The color bands are encoded as follows:\n\n* Black: 0\n* Brown: 1\n* Red: 2\n* Orange: 3\n* Yellow: 4\n* Green: 5\n* Blue: 6\n* Violet: 7\n* Grey: 8\n* White: 9\n\nIn `resistor-color duo` you decoded the first two colors. For instance: orange-orange got the main value `33`.\nThe third color stands for how many zeros need to be added to the main value. The main value plus the zeros gives us a value in ohms.\nFor the exercise it doesn't matter what ohms really are.\nFor example:\n\n- orange-orange-black would be 33 and no zeros, which becomes 33 ohms.\n- orange-orange-red would be 33 and 2 zeros, which becomes 3300 ohms.\n- orange-orange-orange would be 33 and 3 zeros, which becomes 33000 ohms.\n\n(If Math is your thing, you may want to think of the zeros as exponents of 10. If Math is not your thing, go with the zeros. It really is the same thing, just in plain English instead of Math lingo.)\n\nThis exercise is about translating the colors into a label:\n\n> \"... ohms\"\n\nSo an input of `\"orange\", \"orange\", \"black\"` should return:\n\n> \"33 ohms\"\n\nWhen we get more than a thousand ohms, we say \"kiloohms\". That's similar to saying \"kilometer\" for 1000 meters, and \"kilograms\" for 1000 grams.\nSo an input of `\"orange\", \"orange\", \"orange\"` should return:\n\n> \"33 kiloohms\"\n\n", "code": "resistor-color-trio.js\n//\n// This is only a SKELETON file for the 'Resistor Color Trio' exercise.

This\nscale can be expressed as the following group of pitches:\n\n> A, A\u266f, B, C, C\u266f, D, D\u266f, E, F, F\u266f, G, G\u266f\n\nA given sharp note (indicated by a \u266f) can also be expressed as the flat\nof the note above it (indicated by a \u266d) so the chromatic scale can also be\nwritten like this:\n\n> A, B\u266d, B, C, D\u266d, D, E\u266d, E, F, G\u266d, G, A\u266d\n\nThe major and minor scale and modes are subsets of this twelve-pitch\ncollection. They have seven pitches, and are called diatonic scales.\nThe collection of notes in these scales is written with either sharps or\nflats, depending on the tonic (starting note). Here is a table indicating\nwhether the flat expression or sharp expression of the scale would be used for\na given tonic:\n\n| Key Signature | Major                 | Minor                |\n| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |\n| Natural       | C                     | a                    |\n| Sharp         | G, D, A, E, B, F\u266f     | e, b, f\u266f, c\u266f, g\u266f, d\u266f |\n| Flat          | F, B\u266d, E\u266d, A\u266d, D\u266d, G\u266d | d, g, c, f, b\u266d, e\u266d   |\n\nNote that by common music theory convention the natural notes \"C\" and \"a\"\nfollow the sharps scale when ascending and the flats scale when descending.\nFor the scope of this exercise the scale is only ascending.\n\n### Task\n\nGiven a tonic, generate the 12 note chromatic scale starting with the tonic.\n\n- Shift the base scale appropriately so that all 12 notes are returned\n  starting with the given tonic.\n- For the given tonic, determine if the scale is to be returned with flats\n  or sharps.\n- Return all notes in uppercase letters (except for the `b` for flats)\n  irrespective of the casing of the given tonic.\n\n## Diatonic Scales\n\nThe diatonic scales, and all other scales that derive from the\nchromatic scale, are built upon intervals. An interval is the space\nbetween two pitches.\n\nThe simplest interval is between two adjacent notes, and is called a\n\"half step\", or \"minor second\" (sometimes written as a lower-case \"m\").\nThe interval between two notes that have an interceding note is called\na \"whole step\" or \"major second\" (written as an upper-case \"M\"). The\ndiatonic scales are built using only these two intervals between\nadjacent notes.\n\nNon-diatonic scales can contain other intervals. An \"augmented second\"\ninterval, written \"A\", has two interceding notes (e.g., from A to C or D\u266d to E)\nor a \"whole step\" plus a \"half step\". There are also smaller and larger\nintervals, but they will not figure into this exercise.\n\n### Task\n\nGiven a tonic and a set of intervals, generate the musical scale starting with\nthe tonic and following the specified interval pattern.\n\nThis is similar to generating chromatic scales except that instead of returning\n12 notes, you will return N+1 notes for N intervals.\nThe first note is always the given tonic.\nThen, for each interval in the pattern, the next note is determined by starting from the previous note and skipping the number of notes indicated by the interval.\n\nFor example, starting with G and using the seven intervals MMmMMMm, there would be the following eight notes:\n\n| Note | Reason                                            |\n| ---- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n| G    | Tonic                                             |\n| A    | M indicates a whole step from G, skipping G\u266f      |\n| B    | M indicates a whole step from A, skipping A\u266f      |\n| C    | m indicates a half step from B, skipping nothing  |\n| D    | M indicates a whole step from C, skipping C\u266f      |\n| E    | M indicates a whole step from D, skipping D\u266f      |\n| F\u266f   | M indicates a whole step from E, skipping F       |\n| G    | m indicates a half step from F\u266f, skipping nothing |\n\n", "code": "scale-generator.js\n//\n// This is only a SKELETON file for the 'Scale Generator' exercise.

If anyone wishes to decipher these, and get at their\nmeaning, he must substitute the fourth letter of the alphabet, namely D,\nfor A, and so with the others.\"\n\u2014Suetonius, Life of Julius Caesar\n\nCiphers are very straight-forward algorithms that allow us to render\ntext less readable while still allowing easy deciphering. They are\nvulnerable to many forms of cryptanalysis, but Caesar was lucky that\nhis enemies were not cryptanalysts.\n\nThe Caesar Cipher was used for some messages from Julius Caesar that\nwere sent afield. Now Caesar knew that the cipher wasn't very good, but\nhe had one ally in that respect: almost nobody could read well. So even\nbeing a couple letters off was sufficient so that people couldn't\nrecognize the few words that they did know.\n\nYour task is to create a simple shift cipher like the Caesar Cipher.\nThis image is a great example of the Caesar Cipher:\n\n![Caesar Cipher][1]\n\nFor example:\n\nGiving \"iamapandabear\" as input to the encode function returns the cipher \"ldpdsdqgdehdu\". Obscure enough to keep our message secret in transit.\n\nWhen \"ldpdsdqgdehdu\" is put into the decode function it would return\nthe original \"iamapandabear\" letting your friend read your original\nmessage.\n\n## Step 2\n\nShift ciphers quickly cease to be useful when the opposition commander figures them out.\nSo instead, let's try using a substitution cipher.\nTry amending the code to allow us to specify a key and use that for the shift distance.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nGiven the key \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\", encoding the string \"iamapandabear\"\nwould return the original \"iamapandabear\".\n\nGiven the key \"ddddddddddddddddd\", encoding our string \"iamapandabear\"\nwould return the obscured \"ldpdsdqgdehdu\"\n\nIn the example above, we've set a = 0 for the key value. So when the\nplaintext is added to the key, we end up with the same message coming\nout. So \"aaaa\" is not an ideal key. But if we set the key to \"dddd\", we\nwould get the same thing as the Caesar Cipher.\n\n## Step 3\n\nThe weakest link in any cipher is the human being. Let's make your\nsubstitution cipher a little more fault tolerant by providing a source\nof randomness and ensuring that the key contains only lowercase letters.\n\nIf someone doesn't submit a key at all, generate a truly random key of\nat least 100 lowercase characters in length.\n\n## Extensions\n\nShift ciphers work by making the text slightly odd, but are vulnerable\nto frequency analysis. Substitution ciphers help that, but are still\nvery vulnerable when the key is short or if spaces are preserved. Later\non you'll see one solution to this problem in the exercise\n\"crypto-square\".\n\nIf you want to go farther in this field, the questions begin to be about\nhow we can exchange keys in a secure way.

Calculate the sum of all the numbers that are left.\n\nLet's look at an example:\n\n**The player completed level 20 and found two magical items with base values of 3 and 5.**\n\nTo calculate the energy points earned by the player, we need to find all the unique multiples of these base values that are less than level 20.\n\n- Multiples of 3 less than 20: `{3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18}`\n- Multiples of 5 less than 20: `{5, 10, 15}`\n- Combine the sets and remove duplicates: `{3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18}`\n- Sum the unique multiples: `3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18 = 78`\n- Therefore, the player earns **78** energy points for completing level 20 and finding the two magical items with base values of 3 and 5.\n\nintroduction.md\n# Introduction\n\nYou work for a company that makes an online, fantasy-survival game.\n\nWhen a player finishes a level, they are awarded energy points.\nThe amount of energy awarded depends on which magical items the player found while exploring that level.\n\n", "code": "sum-of-multiples.js\n//\n// This is only a SKELETON file for the 'Sum Of Multiples' exercise.

Pouring one bucket into the other bucket until either:\n     a) the first bucket is empty\n     b) the second bucket is full\n  2. Emptying a bucket and doing nothing to the other.\n  3. Filling a bucket and doing nothing to the other.\n- After an action, you may not arrive at a state where the starting bucket is empty and the other bucket is full.\n\nYour program will take as input:\n\n- the size of bucket one\n- the size of bucket two\n- the desired number of liters to reach\n- which bucket to fill first, either bucket one or bucket two\n\nYour program should determine:\n\n- the total number of actions it should take to reach the desired number of liters, including the first fill of the starting bucket\n- which bucket should end up with the desired number of liters - either bucket one or bucket two\n- how many liters are left in the other bucket\n\nNote: any time a change is made to either or both buckets counts as one (1) action.\n\nExample:\nBucket one can hold up to 7 liters, and bucket two can hold up to 11 liters. Let's say at a given step, bucket one is holding 7 liters and bucket two is holding 8 liters (7,8). If you empty bucket one and make no change to bucket two, leaving you with 0 liters and 8 liters respectively (0,8), that counts as one action. Instead, if you had poured from bucket one into bucket two until bucket two was full, resulting in 4 liters in bucket one and 11 liters in bucket two (4,11), that would also only count as one action.\n\nAnother Example:\nBucket one can hold 3 liters, and bucket two can hold up to 5 liters. You are told you must start with bucket one. So your first action is to fill bucket one. You choose to empty bucket one for your second action.
