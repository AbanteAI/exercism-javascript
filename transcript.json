This\n6:scale can be expressed as the following group of pitches:\n7:\n8:> A, A\u266f, B, C, C\u266f, D, D\u266f, E, F, F\u266f, G, G\u266f\n9:\n10:A given sharp note (indicated by a \u266f) can also be expressed as the flat\n11:of the note above it (indicated by a \u266d) so the chromatic scale can also be\n12:written like this:\n13:\n14:> A, B\u266d, B, C, D\u266d, D, E\u266d, E, F, G\u266d, G, A\u266d\n15:\n16:The major and minor scale and modes are subsets of this twelve-pitch\n17:collection. They have seven pitches, and are called diatonic scales.\n18:The collection of notes in these scales is written with either sharps or\n19:flats, depending on the tonic (starting note). Here is a table indicating\n20:whether the flat expression or sharp expression of the scale would be used for\n21:a given tonic:\n22:\n23:| Key Signature | Major                 | Minor                |\n24:| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |\n25:| Natural       | C                     | a                    |\n26:| Sharp         | G, D, A, E, B, F\u266f     | e, b, f\u266f, c\u266f, g\u266f, d\u266f |\n27:| Flat          | F, B\u266d, E\u266d, A\u266d, D\u266d, G\u266d | d, g, c, f, b\u266d, e\u266d   |\n28:\n29:Note that by common music theory convention the natural notes \"C\" and \"a\"\n30:follow the sharps scale when ascending and the flats scale when descending.\n31:For the scope of this exercise the scale is only ascending.\n32:\n33:### Task\n34:\n35:Given a tonic, generate the 12 note chromatic scale starting with the tonic.\n36:\n37:- Shift the base scale appropriately so that all 12 notes are returned\n38:  starting with the given tonic.\n39:- For the given tonic, determine if the scale is to be returned with flats\n40:  or sharps.\n41:- Return all notes in uppercase letters (except for the `b` for flats)\n42:  irrespective of the casing of the given tonic.\n43:\n44:## Diatonic Scales\n45:\n46:The diatonic scales, and all other scales that derive from the\n47:chromatic scale, are built upon intervals. An interval is the space\n48:between two pitches.\n49:\n50:The simplest interval is between two adjacent notes, and is called a\n51:\"half step\", or \"minor second\" (sometimes written as a lower-case \"m\").\n52:The interval between two notes that have an interceding note is called\n53:a \"whole step\" or \"major second\" (written as an upper-case \"M\"). The\n54:diatonic scales are built using only these two intervals between\n55:adjacent notes.\n56:\n57:Non-diatonic scales can contain other intervals. An \"augmented second\"\n58:interval, written \"A\", has two interceding notes (e.g., from A to C or D\u266d to E)\n59:or a \"whole step\" plus a \"half step\". There are also smaller and larger\n60:intervals, but they will not figure into this exercise.\n61:\n62:### Task\n63:\n64:Given a tonic and a set of intervals, generate the musical scale starting with\n65:the tonic and following the specified interval pattern.\n66:\n67:This is similar to generating chromatic scales except that instead of returning\n68:12 notes, you will return N+1 notes for N intervals.\n69:The first note is always the given tonic.\n70:Then, for each interval in the pattern, the next note is determined by starting from the previous note and skipping the number of notes indicated by the interval.\n71:\n72:For example, starting with G and using the seven intervals MMmMMMm, there would be the following eight notes:\n73:\n74:| Note | Reason                                            |\n75:| ---- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n76:| G    | Tonic                                             |\n77:| A    | M indicates a whole step from G, skipping G\u266f      |\n78:| B    | M indicates a whole step from A, skipping A\u266f      |\n79:| C    | m indicates a half step from B, skipping nothing  |\n80:| D    | M indicates a whole step from C, skipping C\u266f      |\n81:| E    | M indicates a whole step from D, skipping D\u266f      |\n82:| F\u266f   | M indicates a whole step from E, skipping F       |\n83:| G    | m indicates a half step from F\u266f, skipping nothing |\n84:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will implement the Scale class in the scale-generator.js file.\n\nSteps:\n1.

For this exercise, you need to know only three things about them:\n4:\n5:- Each resistor has a resistance value.\n6:- Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.\n7:  To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.\n8:- Each band acts as a digit of a number. For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.\n9:  In this exercise, you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands. The program will take 3 colors as input, and outputs the correct value, in ohms.\n10:  The color bands are encoded as follows:\n11:\n12:* Black: 0\n13:* Brown: 1\n14:* Red: 2\n15:* Orange: 3\n16:* Yellow: 4\n17:* Green: 5\n18:* Blue: 6\n19:* Violet: 7\n20:* Grey: 8\n21:* White: 9\n22:\n23:In `resistor-color duo` you decoded the first two colors.

For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.\n9:  In this exercise, you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.

Now Caesar knew that the cipher wasn't very good, but\n21:he had one ally in that respect: almost nobody could read well. So even\n22:being a couple letters off was sufficient so that people couldn't\n23:recognize the few words that they did know.\n24:\n25:Your task is to create a simple shift cipher like the Caesar Cipher.\n26:This image is a great example of the Caesar Cipher:\n27:\n28:![Caesar Cipher][1]\n29:\n30:For example:\n31:\n32:Giving \"iamapandabear\" as input to the encode function returns the cipher \"ldpdsdqgdehdu\".
