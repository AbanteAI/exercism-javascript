This\n6:scale can be expressed as the following group of pitches:\n7:\n8:> A, A\u266f, B, C, C\u266f, D, D\u266f, E, F, F\u266f, G, G\u266f\n9:\n10:A given sharp note (indicated by a \u266f) can also be expressed as the flat\n11:of the note above it (indicated by a \u266d) so the chromatic scale can also be\n12:written like this:\n13:\n14:> A, B\u266d, B, C, D\u266d, D, E\u266d, E, F, G\u266d, G, A\u266d\n15:\n16:The major and minor scale and modes are subsets of this twelve-pitch\n17:collection. They have seven pitches, and are called diatonic scales.\n18:The collection of notes in these scales is written with either sharps or\n19:flats, depending on the tonic (starting note). Here is a table indicating\n20:whether the flat expression or sharp expression of the scale would be used for\n21:a given tonic:\n22:\n23:| Key Signature | Major                 | Minor                |\n24:| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |\n25:| Natural       | C                     | a                    |\n26:| Sharp         | G, D, A, E, B, F\u266f     | e, b, f\u266f, c\u266f, g\u266f, d\u266f |\n27:| Flat          | F, B\u266d, E\u266d, A\u266d, D\u266d, G\u266d | d, g, c, f, b\u266d, e\u266d   |\n28:\n29:Note that by common music theory convention the natural notes \"C\" and \"a\"\n30:follow the sharps scale when ascending and the flats scale when descending.\n31:For the scope of this exercise the scale is only ascending.\n32:\n33:### Task\n34:\n35:Given a tonic, generate the 12 note chromatic scale starting with the tonic.\n36:\n37:- Shift the base scale appropriately so that all 12 notes are returned\n38:  starting with the given tonic.\n39:- For the given tonic, determine if the scale is to be returned with flats\n40:  or sharps.\n41:- Return all notes in uppercase letters (except for the `b` for flats)\n42:  irrespective of the casing of the given tonic.\n43:\n44:## Diatonic Scales\n45:\n46:The diatonic scales, and all other scales that derive from the\n47:chromatic scale, are built upon intervals. An interval is the space\n48:between two pitches.\n49:\n50:The simplest interval is between two adjacent notes, and is called a\n51:\"half step\", or \"minor second\" (sometimes written as a lower-case \"m\").\n52:The interval between two notes that have an interceding note is called\n53:a \"whole step\" or \"major second\" (written as an upper-case \"M\"). The\n54:diatonic scales are built using only these two intervals between\n55:adjacent notes.\n56:\n57:Non-diatonic scales can contain other intervals. An \"augmented second\"\n58:interval, written \"A\", has two interceding notes (e.g., from A to C or D\u266d to E)\n59:or a \"whole step\" plus a \"half step\". There are also smaller and larger\n60:intervals, but they will not figure into this exercise.\n61:\n62:### Task\n63:\n64:Given a tonic and a set of intervals, generate the musical scale starting with\n65:the tonic and following the specified interval pattern.\n66:\n67:This is similar to generating chromatic scales except that instead of returning\n68:12 notes, you will return N+1 notes for N intervals.\n69:The first note is always the given tonic.\n70:Then, for each interval in the pattern, the next note is determined by starting from the previous note and skipping the number of notes indicated by the interval.\n71:\n72:For example, starting with G and using the seven intervals MMmMMMm, there would be the following eight notes:\n73:\n74:| Note | Reason                                            |\n75:| ---- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n76:| G    | Tonic                                             |\n77:| A    | M indicates a whole step from G, skipping G\u266f      |\n78:| B    | M indicates a whole step from A, skipping A\u266f      |\n79:| C    | m indicates a half step from B, skipping nothing  |\n80:| D    | M indicates a whole step from C, skipping C\u266f      |\n81:| E    | M indicates a whole step from D, skipping D\u266f      |\n82:| F\u266f   | M indicates a whole step from E, skipping F       |\n83:| G    | m indicates a half step from F\u266f, skipping nothing |\n84:\n\nexercises/practice/scale-generator/scale-generator.js\n1://\n2:// This is only a SKELETON file for the 'Scale Generator' exercise.

This\n6:scale can be expressed as the following group of pitches:\n7:\n8:> A, A\u266f, B, C, C\u266f, D, D\u266f, E, F, F\u266f, G, G\u266f\n9:\n10:A given sharp note (indicated by a \u266f) can also be expressed as the flat\n11:of the note above it (indicated by a \u266d) so the chromatic scale can also be\n12:written like this:\n13:\n14:> A, B\u266d, B, C, D\u266d, D, E\u266d, E, F, G\u266d, G, A\u266d\n15:\n16:The major and minor scale and modes are subsets of this twelve-pitch\n17:collection. They have seven pitches, and are called diatonic scales.\n18:The collection of notes in these scales is written with either sharps or\n19:flats, depending on the tonic (starting note). Here is a table indicating\n20:whether the flat expression or sharp expression of the scale would be used for\n21:a given tonic:\n22:\n23:| Key Signature | Major                 | Minor                |\n24:| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |\n25:| Natural       | C                     | a                    |\n26:| Sharp         | G, D, A, E, B, F\u266f     | e, b, f\u266f, c\u266f, g\u266f, d\u266f |\n27:| Flat          | F, B\u266d, E\u266d, A\u266d, D\u266d, G\u266d | d, g, c, f, b\u266d, e\u266d   |\n28:\n29:Note that by common music theory convention the natural notes \"C\" and \"a\"\n30:follow the sharps scale when ascending and the flats scale when descending.\n31:For the scope of this exercise the scale is only ascending.\n32:\n33:### Task\n34:\n35:Given a tonic, generate the 12 note chromatic scale starting with the tonic.\n36:\n37:- Shift the base scale appropriately so that all 12 notes are returned\n38:  starting with the given tonic.\n39:- For the given tonic, determine if the scale is to be returned with flats\n40:  or sharps.\n41:- Return all notes in uppercase letters (except for the `b` for flats)\n42:  irrespective of the casing of the given tonic.\n43:\n44:## Diatonic Scales\n45:\n46:The diatonic scales, and all other scales that derive from the\n47:chromatic scale, are built upon intervals. An interval is the space\n48:between two pitches.\n49:\n50:The simplest interval is between two adjacent notes, and is called a\n51:\"half step\", or \"minor second\" (sometimes written as a lower-case \"m\").\n52:The interval between two notes that have an interceding note is called\n53:a \"whole step\" or \"major second\" (written as an upper-case \"M\"). The\n54:diatonic scales are built using only these two intervals between\n55:adjacent notes.\n56:\n57:Non-diatonic scales can contain other intervals. An \"augmented second\"\n58:interval, written \"A\", has two interceding notes (e.g., from A to C or D\u266d to E)\n59:or a \"whole step\" plus a \"half step\". There are also smaller and larger\n60:intervals, but they will not figure into this exercise.\n61:\n62:### Task\n63:\n64:Given a tonic and a set of intervals, generate the musical scale starting with\n65:the tonic and following the specified interval pattern.\n66:\n67:This is similar to generating chromatic scales except that instead of returning\n68:12 notes, you will return N+1 notes for N intervals.\n69:The first note is always the given tonic.\n70:Then, for each interval in the pattern, the next note is determined by starting from the previous note and skipping the number of notes indicated by the interval.\n71:\n72:For example, starting with G and using the seven intervals MMmMMMm, there would be the following eight notes:\n73:\n74:| Note | Reason                                            |\n75:| ---- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n76:| G    | Tonic                                             |\n77:| A    | M indicates a whole step from G, skipping G\u266f      |\n78:| B    | M indicates a whole step from A, skipping A\u266f      |\n79:| C    | m indicates a half step from B, skipping nothing  |\n80:| D    | M indicates a whole step from C, skipping C\u266f      |\n81:| E    | M indicates a whole step from D, skipping D\u266f      |\n82:| F\u266f   | M indicates a whole step from E, skipping F       |\n83:| G    | m indicates a half step from F\u266f, skipping nothing |\n84:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will implement the Scale class in the scale-generator.js file according to the instructions.\n\nSteps:\n1.

This\n6:scale can be expressed as the following group of pitches:\n7:\n8:> A, A\u266f, B, C, C\u266f, D, D\u266f, E, F, F\u266f, G, G\u266f\n9:\n10:A given sharp note (indicated by a \u266f) can also be expressed as the flat\n11:of the note above it (indicated by a \u266d) so the chromatic scale can also be\n12:written like this:\n13:\n14:> A, B\u266d, B, C, D\u266d, D, E\u266d, E, F, G\u266d, G, A\u266d\n15:\n16:The major and minor scale and modes are subsets of this twelve-pitch\n17:collection. They have seven pitches, and are called diatonic scales.\n18:The collection of notes in these scales is written with either sharps or\n19:flats, depending on the tonic (starting note). Here is a table indicating\n20:whether the flat expression or sharp expression of the scale would be used for\n21:a given tonic:\n22:\n23:| Key Signature | Major                 | Minor                |\n24:| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |\n25:| Natural       | C                     | a                    |\n26:| Sharp         | G, D, A, E, B, F\u266f     | e, b, f\u266f, c\u266f, g\u266f, d\u266f |\n27:| Flat          | F, B\u266d, E\u266d, A\u266d, D\u266d, G\u266d | d, g, c, f, b\u266d, e\u266d   |\n28:\n29:Note that by common music theory convention the natural notes \"C\" and \"a\"\n30:follow the sharps scale when ascending and the flats scale when descending.\n31:For the scope of this exercise the scale is only ascending.\n32:\n33:### Task\n34:\n35:Given a tonic, generate the 12 note chromatic scale starting with the tonic.\n36:\n37:- Shift the base scale appropriately so that all 12 notes are returned\n38:  starting with the given tonic.\n39:- For the given tonic, determine if the scale is to be returned with flats\n40:  or sharps.\n41:- Return all notes in uppercase letters (except for the `b` for flats)\n42:  irrespective of the casing of the given tonic.\n43:\n44:## Diatonic Scales\n45:\n46:The diatonic scales, and all other scales that derive from the\n47:chromatic scale, are built upon intervals. An interval is the space\n48:between two pitches.\n49:\n50:The simplest interval is between two adjacent notes, and is called a\n51:\"half step\", or \"minor second\" (sometimes written as a lower-case \"m\").\n52:The interval between two notes that have an interceding note is called\n53:a \"whole step\" or \"major second\" (written as an upper-case \"M\"). The\n54:diatonic scales are built using only these two intervals between\n55:adjacent notes.\n56:\n57:Non-diatonic scales can contain other intervals. An \"augmented second\"\n58:interval, written \"A\", has two interceding notes (e.g., from A to C or D\u266d to E)\n59:or a \"whole step\" plus a \"half step\". There are also smaller and larger\n60:intervals, but they will not figure into this exercise.\n61:\n62:### Task\n63:\n64:Given a tonic and a set of intervals, generate the musical scale starting with\n65:the tonic and following the specified interval pattern.\n66:\n67:This is similar to generating chromatic scales except that instead of returning\n68:12 notes, you will return N+1 notes for N intervals.\n69:The first note is always the given tonic.\n70:Then, for each interval in the pattern, the next note is determined by starting from the previous note and skipping the number of notes indicated by the interval.\n71:\n72:For example, starting with G and using the seven intervals MMmMMMm, there would be the following eight notes:\n73:\n74:| Note | Reason                                            |\n75:| ---- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n76:| G    | Tonic                                             |\n77:| A    | M indicates a whole step from G, skipping G\u266f      |\n78:| B    | M indicates a whole step from A, skipping A\u266f      |\n79:| C    | m indicates a half step from B, skipping nothing  |\n80:| D    | M indicates a whole step from C, skipping C\u266f      |\n81:| E    | M indicates a whole step from D, skipping D\u266f      |\n82:| F\u266f   | M indicates a whole step from E, skipping F       |\n83:| G    | m indicates a half step from F\u266f, skipping nothing |\n84:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I apologize for the error.

Let's say at a given step, bucket one is holding 7 liters and bucket two is holding 8 liters (7,8). If you empty bucket one and make no change to bucket two, leaving you with 0 liters and 8 liters respectively (0,8), that counts as one action. Instead, if you had poured from bucket one into bucket two until bucket two was full, resulting in 4 liters in bucket one and 11 liters in bucket two (4,11), that would also only count as one action.\n33:\n34:Another Example:\n35:Bucket one can hold 3 liters, and bucket two can hold up to 5 liters. You are told you must start with bucket one. So your first action is to fill bucket one. You choose to empty bucket one for your second action. For your third action, you may not fill bucket two, because this violates the third rule -- you may not end up in a state after any action where the starting bucket is empty and the other bucket is full.\n36:\n37:Written with <3 at [Fullstack Academy](http://www.fullstackacademy.com/) by Lindsay Levine.\n38:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will implement the TwoBucket class in the two-bucket.js file according to the instructions provided.\n\nSteps:\n1.

A common pattern for those callback functions is that they accept an \"error\" as first parameter (see example below).\n6:\n7:```javascript\n8:function callback(error, arg2, arg3) {}\n9:```\n10:\n11:How is it related to asynchronous code ?\n12:\n13:Historically, callbacks have been used in order to allow us to do some work after an asynchronous task was done and without blocking the whole program.\n14:\n15:```javascript\n16:fetchProduct(productId, function (error, data) {\n17:  if (error) {\n18:    // Handle the error\n19:  } else {\n20:    // Do some work\n21:  }\n22:});\n23:```\n24:\n25:In the example above, the `fetchProduct` function (which is asynchronous), takes a callback as a second argument that decides what to do when the product data has been retrieved.\n26:\n\nexercises/practice/promises/.docs/instructions.md\n1:# Instructions\n2:\n3:The two objectives of this exercise are :\n4:\n5:1. Implement a `promisify` function that turns a function using the \"callback pattern\" into a function that returns a `Promise`. See the example below.\n6:\n7:```javascript\n8:function fetchProduct(productId, function(error, data) {\n9:    if (error) {\n10:        // Handle the error\n11:    } else {\n12:        // Make something with your data\n13:    }\n14:})\n15:\n16:const fetchProductAsPromise = promisify(fetchProduct);\n17:\n18:// Now you got a function `fetchProductAsPromise`\n19:// that returns a promise\n20:fetchProductAsPromise(productId)\n21:    .then((data) => {})\n22:    .catch((error) => {});\n23:```\n24:\n25:2.

A common pattern for those callback functions is that they accept an \"error\" as first parameter (see example below).\n6:\n7:```javascript\n8:function callback(error, arg2, arg3) {}\n9:```\n10:\n11:How is it related to asynchronous code ?\n12:\n13:Historically, callbacks have been used in order to allow us to do some work after an asynchronous task was done and without blocking the whole program.\n14:\n15:```javascript\n16:fetchProduct(productId, function (error, data) {\n17:  if (error) {\n18:    // Handle the error\n19:  } else {\n20:    // Do some work\n21:  }\n22:});\n23:```\n24:\n25:In the example above, the `fetchProduct` function (which is asynchronous), takes a callback as a second argument that decides what to do when the product data has been retrieved.\n26:\n\nexercises/practice/promises/.docs/instructions.md\n1:# Instructions\n2:\n3:The two objectives of this exercise are :\n4:\n5:1. Implement a `promisify` function that turns a function using the \"callback pattern\" into a function that returns a `Promise`. See the example below.\n6:\n7:```javascript\n8:function fetchProduct(productId, function(error, data) {\n9:    if (error) {\n10:        // Handle the error\n11:    } else {\n12:        // Make something with your data\n13:    }\n14:})\n15:\n16:const fetchProductAsPromise = promisify(fetchProduct);\n17:\n18:// Now you got a function `fetchProductAsPromise`\n19:// that returns a promise\n20:fetchProductAsPromise(productId)\n21:    .then((data) => {})\n22:    .catch((error) => {});\n23:```\n24:\n25:2. Re-implement the following built-ins `Promise` methods (without using them)\n26:\n27:- `all`: takes an array of promises and resolves when _all_ of them are resolved, or rejects when _one_ of them rejects.\n28:- `allSettled`: takes an array of promises and resolves when _all_ of them either resolve or reject.\n29:- `race`: takes an array of promises and resolves or rejects with the value of the _first_ promise that resolves or rejects.\n30:- `any`: takes an array of promises and resolves when _one_ of them resolves, or rejects when _all_ of them reject.\n31:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I apologize for the error.

For this exercise, you need to know only three things about them:\n4:\n5:- Each resistor has a resistance value.\n6:- Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.\n7:  To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.\n8:- Each band acts as a digit of a number. For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.\n9:  In this exercise, you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands. The program will take 3 colors as input, and outputs the correct value, in ohms.\n10:  The color bands are encoded as follows:\n11:\n12:* Black: 0\n13:* Brown: 1\n14:* Red: 2\n15:* Orange: 3\n16:* Yellow: 4\n17:* Green: 5\n18:* Blue: 6\n19:* Violet: 7\n20:* Grey: 8\n21:* White: 9\n22:\n23:In `resistor-color duo` you decoded the first two colors. For instance: orange-orange got the main value `33`.\n24:The third color stands for how many zeros need to be added to the main value. The main value plus the zeros gives us a value in ohms.\n25:For the exercise it doesn't matter what ohms really are.\n26:For example:\n27:\n28:- orange-orange-black would be 33 and no zeros, which becomes 33 ohms.\n29:- orange-orange-red would be 33 and 2 zeros, which becomes 3300 ohms.\n30:- orange-orange-orange would be 33 and 3 zeros, which becomes 33000 ohms.\n31:\n32:(If Math is your thing, you may want to think of the zeros as exponents of 10.

A frame is composed of one or two ball\n12:throws with 10 pins standing at frame initialization. There are three\n13:cases for the tabulation of a frame.\n14:\n15:- An open frame is where a score of less than 10 is recorded for the\n16:  frame. In this case the score for the frame is the number of pins\n17:  knocked down.\n18:\n19:- A spare is where all ten pins are knocked down by the second\n20:  throw. The total value of a spare is 10 plus the number of pins\n21:  knocked down in their next throw.\n22:\n23:- A strike is where all ten pins are knocked down by the first\n24:  throw. The total value of a strike is 10 plus the number of pins\n25:  knocked down in the next two throws. If a strike is immediately\n26:  followed by a second strike, then the value of the first strike\n27:  cannot be determined until the ball is thrown one more time.\n28:\n29:Here is a three frame example:\n30:\n31:|  Frame 1   |  Frame 2   |     Frame 3      |\n32:| :--------: | :--------: | :--------------: |\n33:| X (strike) | 5/ (spare) | 9 0 (open frame) |\n34:\n35:Frame 1 is (10 + 5 + 5) = 20\n36:\n37:Frame 2 is (5 + 5 + 9) = 19\n38:\n39:Frame 3 is (9 + 0) = 9\n40:\n41:This means the current running total is 48.\n42:\n43:The tenth frame in the game is a special case. If someone throws a\n44:strike or a spare then they get a fill ball. Fill balls exist to\n45:calculate the total of the 10th frame. Scoring a strike or spare on\n46:the fill ball does not give the player more fill balls. The total\n47:value of the 10th frame is the total number of pins knocked down.\n48:\n49:For a tenth frame of X1/ (strike and a spare), the total value is 20.\n50:\n51:For a tenth frame of XXX (three strikes), the total value is 30.\n52:\n53:## Requirements\n54:\n55:Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling.

The\n59:  argument is the number of pins knocked down.\n60:- `score() : int` is called only at the very end of the game.

Write code to keep track of the score\n7:of a game of bowling.\n8:\n9:## Scoring Bowling\n10:\n11:The game consists of 10 frames. A frame is composed of one or two ball\n12:throws with 10 pins standing at frame initialization. There are three\n13:cases for the tabulation of a frame.\n14:\n15:- An open frame is where a score of less than 10 is recorded for the\n16:  frame. In this case the score for the frame is the number of pins\n17:  knocked down.\n18:\n19:- A spare is where all ten pins are knocked down by the second\n20:  throw. The total value of a spare is 10 plus the number of pins\n21:  knocked down in their next throw.\n22:\n23:- A strike is where all ten pins are knocked down by the first\n24:  throw. The total value of a strike is 10 plus the number of pins\n25:  knocked down in the next two throws. If a strike is immediately\n26:  followed by a second strike, then the value of the first strike\n27:  cannot be determined until the ball is thrown one more time.\n28:\n29:Here is a three frame example:\n30:\n31:|  Frame 1   |  Frame 2   |     Frame 3      |\n32:| :--------: | :--------: | :--------------: |\n33:| X (strike) | 5/ (spare) | 9 0 (open frame) |\n34:\n35:Frame 1 is (10 + 5 + 5) = 20\n36:\n37:Frame 2 is (5 + 5 + 9) = 19\n38:\n39:Frame 3 is (9 + 0) = 9\n40:\n41:This means the current running total is 48.\n42:\n43:The tenth frame in the game is a special case. If someone throws a\n44:strike or a spare then they get a fill ball. Fill balls exist to\n45:calculate the total of the 10th frame. Scoring a strike or spare on\n46:the fill ball does not give the player more fill balls. The total\n47:value of the 10th frame is the total number of pins knocked down.\n48:\n49:For a tenth frame of X1/ (strike and a spare), the total value is 20.\n50:\n51:For a tenth frame of XXX (three strikes), the total value is 30.\n52:\n53:## Requirements\n54:\n55:Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling. It should\n56:support two operations:\n57:\n58:- `roll(pins : int)` is called each time the player rolls a ball. The\n59:  argument is the number of pins knocked down.\n60:- `score() : int` is called only at the very end of the game. It\n61:  returns the total score for that game.\n62:\n\nexercises/practice/bowling/bowling.js\n1://\n2:// This is only a SKELETON file for the 'Bowling' exercise.

In the case the check character is an X, this represents the value '10'. These may be communicated with or without hyphens, and can be checked for their validity by the following formula:\n9:\n10:```\n11:(x1 * 10 + x2 * 9 + x3 * 8 + x4 * 7 + x5 * 6 + x6 * 5 + x7 * 4 + x8 * 3 + x9 * 2 + x10 * 1) mod 11 == 0\n12:```\n13:\n14:If the result is 0, then it is a valid ISBN-10, otherwise it is invalid.\n15:\n16:## Example\n17:\n18:Let's take the ISBN-10 `3-598-21508-8`.
