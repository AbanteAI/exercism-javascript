    ✓ reading empty buffer should fail (13 ms)
    ○ skipped can read an item just written
    ○ skipped each item may only be read once
    ○ skipped items are read in the order they are written
    ○ skipped full buffer can't be written to
    ○ skipped a read frees up capacity for another write
    ○ skipped read position is maintained even across multiple writes
    ○ skipped items cleared out of buffer can't be read
    ○ skipped clear frees up capacity for another write
    ○ skipped clear does nothing on empty buffer
    ○ skipped forceWrite acts like write on non-full buffer
    ○ skipped forceWrite replaces the oldest item on full buffer
    ○ skipped forceWrite replaces the oldest item remaining in buffer following a read
