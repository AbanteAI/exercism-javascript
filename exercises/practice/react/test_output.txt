  React module
    ✓ accepts input (2 ms)
    ○ skipped allows input cell value to be set
    ○ skipped allows setting compute cells
    ○ skipped compute cell takes inputs in correct order
    ○ skipped compute cells update value when inputs are changed
    ○ skipped compute cells can depend on other compute cells
    ○ skipped compute cells fire callbacks
    ○ skipped callbacks fire only when output values change
    ○ skipped static callbacks fire even if their own value has not changed
    ○ skipped callbacks can be added and removed
    ○ skipped removing a callback multiple times doesn't interfere with other callbacks
    ○ skipped callbacks should only be called once, even if multiple dependencies change
    ○ skipped callbacks should not be called if dependencies change but output value doesn't change
